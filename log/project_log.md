- NOTE: Resumes before 2007-10-02 are stored as pdf - *need download function for pdf files*

- Validating data:
    - about 490 with mismatch between agenda length and item length - "Spørgsmål til ministeren" a different format.

    - Adding "meddelelser fra Formanden"
    - Separating items based on "ShortTitle" instead of ItemNo (fits format "Spørgsmål til ministeren" as well)
